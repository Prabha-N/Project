    <h1>SAFETY TIPS</h1>
    <marquee direction="up" scrollamount="5">
    <h2>HOW TO FIGHT CRIME</h2>
    <h3>Protecting Yourself</h3>
    <p> Avoid walking by yourself at night, particularly though poorly lit areas. Stay alert to your surroundings, and be mindful of people who may be watching or following you.</p>
    <h3>Watch for suspicious drug activity.</h3>
    <p>Drug houses, where illegal drugs are bought and sold, can appear in any kind of neighborhood, especially ones where people are generally isolated. If you notice the signs of drug activity surrounding a house in your neighborhood, take note, and contact the police. These can include:</p>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>Excessive or unusual foot traffic around a house. This can involve many people coming and going, people loitering around, or frequent visitors quickly entering and leaving.
        <li>Frequent traffic stops, especially if someone from the house comes out to talk to these cars.</li>
        <li>Threatening activity, including obvious intimidation and violence, or a sudden increase in criminal activity around the house.</li>
        <li>The direct exchange of drugs and money.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Watch for suspicious terrorist activity.</h3>
    <p>Keep an eye out for strange or unusual situations that can indicate a crime or potential crime involving terrorism. These can include:</p>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>Unattended briefcases, suitcases, backpacks, or other packages.</li>
        <li>Unusual smells or fumes.</li>
        <li>Strangers asking questions about security procedures, or taking photos or videos of a building's security features.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Get details about any crime you witness.</h3>
    <p>In order to help, police will need as much detail as possible. Get as much information as you can to share with law enforcement. If possible, be sure to include:</P>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>The crime being committed.</li>
        <li>The crime's location. A physical address is good, but you can also note important landmarks nearby. If you are in an urbanized area, the nearest cross streets are good to know.</li>
        <li>A description of the suspect. Look for any kind of distinguishing physical characteristic, including height, weight, build, skin and hair color, and physical markings (like scars or tattoos). You don't need all of these things, but the more detail you can get, the better it will be.</li>
        <li>Any items in use. Are the criminals armed? Do they have tools to carry out the specific crime they are committing?</li>
        <li>A description of the victim. This can be the person being victimized, or the building, in the case of vandalism, breaking and entering, and other types of property crime.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Tips For When You're In And Around Your Car</h2>
<p>Most of us spend so much time in and around our cars. We are not only at risk from other drivers crashing into us but from criminals who prey on our lack of awareness.</p>
<h2>Traffic safety</h2>
<p>While driving, stop just far enough away from the car in front of you at a traffic light to leave enough room to quickly escape (to the left or right) if somebody tries to hijack (carjack) you.
An easy way to be sure you are at the right distance: make sure you can see the car in front's rear tires touching the road surface.</p>
<h2>Self Defense Basics You Can Learn</h2>
<h2>Improve your awareness</h2>
<p> Learning to look around and be conscious of the people and vehicles nearby is crucial for staying safe.
    This is a skill that is so simple on the one hand, but also has such depth. After learning to be more aware, you can go on refining this skill for years and continue to improve upon it. Strangely enough, criminals may be the MOST aware of all of us! Their lives often depend on being aware of their surroundings.</p>
<h2>Avoid Stupid People, Stupid places and stupid times</h2>
<p><ul type="circle">
    <li>"Stupid people" are those who attract violence by getting you into dangerous situations.
        Again, this is usually referring to young men and the drunken bar or nightclub scene. It could also refer to any friend or even a family member who always seems to find trouble. Avoid them, even if it means cutting ties with someone you have known your whole life.</li>
    <li>"Stupid Places" are places where violence occurs frequently. Bars and nightclubs are again at the top of that list, but dark alleyways, inner city areas, lonely parks or parking lots at night also fit this definition. Use your brain here. Most of us know where the dangerous places are, but we choose to ignore our instincts.</li>
    <li>"Stupid Times" are usually at night. We all know that the criminal element likes to operate at night. There are many reasons for this, but all you need to remember is that anytime you're out at night, you are at increased risk of criminal attack. Convenience stores, gas stations and 24 hour ATM machines are all HIGH RISK places to visit during the night time hours. The later you are out, the greater the danger.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Watch your personal space</h2>
<p>An essential part of any criminal attack is closing distance with the victim. The criminal has to close that distance between you and him before he can punch, stab or grab you. </p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Wait for you to come closer to him, by hiding in a doorway or other concealed location
Move closer to you, usually by employing a "ruse" or trick of some kind.
</li></ul>
<p>The first way can be defeated by making sure that you're aware of your surroundings and looking out for suspicious people. The second method can be tougher to combat. Criminals are EXPERTS at deceiving their victims. There are numerous ways they can trick you into allowing them to come closer.</P>
<p>Having said that, you can EASILY learn to spot this setup. Just keep in mind, that whenever a stranger in public tries to get closer to you and engage you in some kind of conversation, they are either trying to get something from you...</P>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>In an innocent way (the time, your change or perhaps by trying to sell you something)
Using violence or the threat of violence (a robbery or mugging situation)</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid danger, simply be very suspicious of ANY stranger that approaches you for ANY reason while youâ€™re out in public. They MAY have good intentions, but they may also be trying to trick you into allowing them to get close enough for an attack. Beware!</p>
<h2>Awareness:</h2>
<p>Learning to be more conscious of your surroundings is often mentioned in books about self defense and crime avoidance. There's a good reason for it. Simply put, if you can truly enhance your skills of noticing bad guys BEFORE they have committed to attacking you, you'll the have the choice to:</p>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>Avoid them by slipping away unnoticed
Prepare yourself for attack (mentally and physically)
Ask others for help
Proactively attack the criminals</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice will be YOURS!
Instead of being overwhelmed by their attack, YOU will be the one with options. </P>
<p>I mean paying careful attention to the behaviour and actions of the people around you, in order to spot things that are out of place. Specifically, you are watching for things like:</P>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>People who are watching you intently (Remember that criminals often "stalk" their victims before attacking)</li>
    <li>Behaviour that seems out of place (for example, a strange man paying a little TOO much attention to a child)</li>
    <li>Someone discreetly pulling a handgun or other weapon out from under their jacket</li>
<li>Someone stealing an item from a store shelf</li>
</ul>
<p>There are literally thousands of different things you might see if you really start noticing the world around you...</P>
