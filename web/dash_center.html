               <h3>AWARENESS FOR CRIME PREVENTION</h3>
               <p>Awareness is required before applying any personal safety or self-defense tactics, techniques, and procedures. There are no absolute or foolproof techniques and security hardware that can guarantee personal safety and security. We live in a changing world and safe conditions can never be completely defined or guaranteed.
               Personal security cannot be delegated to others.
Personal safety is your responsibility!
               Effective personal security must be dynamic or fluid, in that awareness of danger must be constantly assessed. Security is never static, simply because the diverse risks which confront us are always changing. Similar to weather changes involving fluctuations which can result in potential dangers, so do criminals change their locations and motives that also fluctuate in potential situational dangerousness.</p>
               <h3>Personal Safety Tips</h3>
               <p>Statistically, single women are at higher risk of having their personal safety threatened. However, men can benefit from many of the tactics and techniques covered in any of the personal safety sections. Since we should not cower inside our homes to hide from violent crime, personal safety tips can assist in avoiding violent criminals by recognizing their ploys, tricks, and methods of approach, which may be used to avoid being victimized, escape from an impending attack, or apply more effective counter measures.
Personal safety relates to protection against robbery, rape, and kidnapping. Personal safety tactics and techniques guard against ATM robbery, street robbery, and workplace crimes. Other personal safety tips include avoiding violent crimes revolving around mobile phone crimes, defense against violent purse snatching, shopping safety and safely using elevators and enclosed staircases.
Our upcoming personal safety sections describe how to utilize effective crime prevention precautions in various situations, especially addressing violent crime. Personal safety crime prevention techniques and tactics that enhance safety in everyday situations, such as walking, jogging, running errands, working, and attending school will be posted.

<h3>Tips For When You're In And Around Your Car</h3>
<p>Most of us spend so much time in and around our cars. We are not only at risk from other drivers crashing into us but from criminals who prey on our lack of awareness.</p>
<h3>Traffic safety</h3>
<p>While driving, stop just far enough away from the car in front of you at a traffic light to leave enough room to quickly escape (to the left or right) if somebody tries to hijack (carjack) you.
An easy way to be sure you are at the right distance: make sure you can see the car in front's rear tires touching the road surface.</p>
<h2>Self Defense Basics You Can Learn:</h2>
<h3>Improve your awareness</h3>
<p> Learning to look around and be conscious of the people and vehicles nearby is crucial for staying safe.
    This is a skill that is so simple on the one hand, but also has such depth. After learning to be more aware, you can go on refining this skill for years and continue to improve upon it. Strangely enough, criminals may be the MOST aware of all of us! Their lives often depend on being aware of their surroundings.</p>
<h3>Avoid Stupid People, Stupid places and stupid times</h3>
<p><ul type="circle">
    <li>"Stupid people" are those who attract violence by getting you into dangerous situations.
        Again, this is usually referring to young men and the drunken bar or nightclub scene. It could also refer to any friend or even a family member who always seems to find trouble. Avoid them, even if it means cutting ties with someone you have known your whole life.</li>
    <li>"Stupid Places" are places where violence occurs frequently. Bars and nightclubs are again at the top of that list, but dark alleyways, inner city areas, lonely parks or parking lots at night also fit this definition. Use your brain here. Most of us know where the dangerous places are, but we choose to ignore our instincts.</li>
    <li>"Stupid Times" are usually at night. We all know that the criminal element likes to operate at night. There are many reasons for this, but all you need to remember is that anytime you're out at night, you are at increased risk of criminal attack. Convenience stores, gas stations and 24 hour ATM machines are all HIGH RISK places to visit during the night time hours. The later you are out, the greater the danger.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Watch your personal space</h3>
<p>An essential part of any criminal attack is closing distance with the victim. The criminal has to close that distance between you and him before he can punch, stab or grab you. </p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Wait for you to come closer to him, by hiding in a doorway or other concealed location
Move closer to you, usually by employing a "ruse" or trick of some kind.
</li></ul>
<p>The first way can be defeated by making sure that you're aware of your surroundings and looking out for suspicious people. The second method can be tougher to combat. Criminals are EXPERTS at deceiving their victims. There are numerous ways they can trick you into allowing them to come closer.</P>
<p>Having said that, you can EASILY learn to spot this setup. Just keep in mind, that whenever a stranger in public tries to get closer to you and engage you in some kind of conversation, they are either trying to get something from you...</P>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>In an innocent way (the time, your change or perhaps by trying to sell you something)
Using violence or the threat of violence (a robbery or mugging situation)</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid danger, simply be very suspicious of ANY stranger that approaches you for ANY reason while youâ€™re out in public. They MAY have good intentions, but they may also be trying to trick you into allowing them to get close enough for an attack. Beware!</p>
<h3>Awareness:</h3>
<p>Learning to be more conscious of your surroundings is often mentioned in books about self defense and crime avoidance. There's a good reason for it. Simply put, if you can truly enhance your skills of noticing bad guys BEFORE they have committed to attacking you, you'll the have the choice to:</p>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>Avoid them by slipping away unnoticed
Prepare yourself for attack (mentally and physically)
Ask others for help
Proactively attack the criminals</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice will be YOURS!
Instead of being overwhelmed by their attack, YOU will be the one with options. </P>
<p>I mean paying careful attention to the behaviour and actions of the people around you, in order to spot things that are out of place. Specifically, you are watching for things like:</P>
<ul type="circle">
    <li>People who are watching you intently (Remember that criminals often "stalk" their victims before attacking)</li>
    <li>Behaviour that seems out of place (for example, a strange man paying a little TOO much attention to a child)</li>
    <li>Someone discreetly pulling a handgun or other weapon out from under their jacket</li>
<li>Someone stealing an item from a store shelf</li>
</ul>
<p>There are literally thousands of different things you might see if you really start noticing the world around you...</P>
